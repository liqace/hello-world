# hello-world

Hello fellow wizards!

I'm a M.Sc. (Econ) student with an ICT minor. I have taken courses in Python, Java, SQL and currently studying C, software engineering and software quality control. Through my work I have experience in two different membership registry / ERP projects from the client side.

This is mainly my "civil" site. The codes you find from my profile are purely for recreational purposes. First hobby project will be my own home automation system with a raspberry pi and arduino.
